# Xiaopai HTTP Command API

This server exposes local HTTP endpoints for Xiaopai voice upload, TTS playback, and command delivery.

Default base URL:

```text
http://<server-ip>:8091
```

For local tests on the server machine:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8091
```

## Device ID

Command endpoints can omit `device_id`. When it is omitted, the server queues the command for the first currently online device, based on the order devices checked in through `/device/next-command`, `/device/ack`, or `/upload`. Devices are considered online for 90 seconds after their last check-in.

Pass `device_id` only when you need to target a specific device.

The firmware currently uses the ESP32 MAC address as its device ID. You can list recently connected devices:

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/devices'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "type": "devices",
  "default_device_id": "44:1b:f6:e4:83:8c",
  "online_ttl_seconds": 90,
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "44:1b:f6:e4:83:8c",
      "last_seen_seconds_ago": 1.2,
      "online": true,
      "pending_commands": 0,
      "last_ack": {
        "cmd_id": "cmd_123",
        "status": "done",
        "message": "",
        "ts": 1780761026.82
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Health

```http
GET /health
```

Test:

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/health'
```

## Send Commands

All command shortcuts support `GET`, so they can be called from a browser.

### Speak

Queues a TTS command. Xiaopai will pause listening, stream TTS audio from `/stream-speak`, play it, then resume listening.

```http
GET /command/speak?text=<text>
```

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/speak' \
  --data-urlencode 'text=早上好，我已经收到你的问题啦。'
```

### Face

Queues a simple expression display command.

```http
GET /command/face?expression=<expression>
```

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/face' \
  --data-urlencode 'expression=happy_squint'
```

Common expression values are free-form strings for now, such as:

```text
calm
shy
thinking
heart
heart_small
wink_half
wink_closed
happy_squint
happy_squint_soft
listening
stopped
```

Voice shortcuts use `开心` for `happy_squint` and `眯眼笑` for `happy_squint_soft`.

The firmware also supports animated expression actions through the same face command:

```text
blink
wink
heart_action
hearting
nod
nodding
speak
speaking
happy_dynamic
happy_squint_dynamic
```

Shortcut routes are available for browser/manual testing:

```http
GET /expressions
GET /expression/<name>
GET /action/<name>
```

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/expression/shy'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/expression/thinking'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/action/blink'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/action/wink'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/action/heart_action'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/action/nod'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/action/happy_dynamic'
```

The generic command endpoint also accepts expression/action aliases:

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/expression' \
  --data-urlencode 'name=害羞'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/action' \
  --data-urlencode 'action=点头'
```

Chinese aliases are accepted in query params and shortcut paths:

```text
害羞 -> shy
思考 -> thinking
眨眼 -> wink
爱心 -> heart_action
点头 -> nod
开心 -> happy_squint
```

### Motion

Moves the head servos. The simplified motion API uses only `type` and `degree`.

```http
GET /command/move?type=left|right|up|down|center&degree=<deg>
```

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/move' \
  --data-urlencode 'type=left' \
  --data-urlencode 'degree=15'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/move' \
  --data-urlencode 'type=right' \
  --data-urlencode 'degree=15'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/move' \
  --data-urlencode 'type=up' \
  --data-urlencode 'degree=10'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/move' \
  --data-urlencode 'type=down' \
  --data-urlencode 'degree=10'

curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/move' \
  --data-urlencode 'type=center'
```

`/command/motion` also accepts the same simplified params:

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/motion' \
  --data-urlencode 'type=left' \
  --data-urlencode 'degree=15' \
  --data-urlencode 'duration_ms=500'
```

The older absolute `pan` / `tilt` form is still supported for debugging.

Firmware limits:

```text
pan:  -180 to 180 degrees
tilt:   0 to 90 degrees
```

### Sequence

Queues a small built-in sequence from GET params.

```http
GET /command/sequence?expression=<expression>&text=<text>
```

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/sequence' \
  --data-urlencode 'expression=thinking' \
  --data-urlencode 'text=让我想一下这个问题。'
```

You can also pass full JSON steps in `payload`:

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/sequence' \
  --data-urlencode 'payload=[{"type":"face","expression":"thinking"},{"type":"move","action":"left","degree":15,"duration_ms":400},{"type":"speak","text":"让我想一下这个问题。"}]'
```

### Stop

Stops current speaker playback and displays `stopped`.

```http
GET /command/stop
```

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/command/stop'
```

## Full Command Schema

```http
POST /command
Content-Type: application/json
```

Commands support `priority`, `interrupt`, `ttl_seconds`, `discardable`, and `coalesce_key`.
Defaults make `stop`, volume, find-owner/camera, and face commands outrank motion and speak.
Low-priority speak/motion/face commands are discardable; repeated speak/face/motion commands keep the newest pending value.

```json
{
  "type": "sequence",
  "priority": 0,
  "interrupt": false,
  "payload": [
    {"type": "face", "expression": "thinking"},
    {"type": "move", "action": "left", "degree": 15, "duration_ms": 400},
    {"type": "speak", "text": "让我想一下这个问题。"}
  ]
}
```

Server queued response:

```json
{
  "type": "queued",
  "device_id": "44:1b:f6:e4:83:8c",
  "command": {
    "cmd_id": "cmd_ef0dcb4b73b7",
    "type": "speak",
    "priority": 10,
    "interrupt": false,
    "ttl_seconds": 30.0,
    "discardable": true,
    "coalesce_key": "speak",
    "payload": {"text": "早上好"},
    "created_at": 1780760998.46
  }
}
```

## Device Command Channel

The firmware calls this endpoint continuously with long polling:

```http
GET /device/next-command?device_id=<id>&timeout=25
```

If a command is queued:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "device_id": "44:1b:f6:e4:83:8c",
  "command": {
    "cmd_id": "cmd_ef0dcb4b73b7",
    "type": "speak",
    "priority": 0,
    "interrupt": false,
    "payload": {"text": "早上好"},
    "created_at": 1780760998.46
  }
}
```

If no command arrives before timeout:

```json
{"type": "noop", "device_id": "44:1b:f6:e4:83:8c"}
```

## ACK

The firmware ACKs command states:

```http
GET /device/ack?device_id=<id>&cmd_id=<cmd_id>&status=received
GET /device/ack?device_id=<id>&cmd_id=<cmd_id>&status=done
GET /device/ack?device_id=<id>&cmd_id=<cmd_id>&status=failed
```

Response:

```json
{
  "type": "ack",
  "device_id": "44:1b:f6:e4:83:8c",
  "ack": {
    "cmd_id": "cmd_ef0dcb4b73b7",
    "status": "done",
    "message": "",
    "ts": 1780761026.82
  }
}
```

## Device Events

Xiaopai can report non-speech events to the server:

```http
GET /device/event?device_id=<device_id>&type=head_touch&name=click
POST /device/event
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "device_id": "44:1b:f6:e4:83:8c",
  "type": "head_touch",
  "name": "click"
}
```

`head_touch` and `touch` are handled locally as a shortcut: the server queues a `face` command with expression `shy`, reports `openclaw_sent: false`, and returns without forwarding to OpenClaw. This preserves immediate touch feedback even when OpenClaw is configured.

Other device events can be forwarded to OpenClaw as short plain-text chat messages such as `小派设备事件：设备 robot-001，事件类型 button_press，事件名称 side_button。`. The server does not parse the returned text. When the response needs Xiaopai presentation, OpenClaw should queue behavior through `xiaopaiControl.execute` or the HTTP command endpoints such as `POST /command`, `GET /command/<type>`, `GET /expression/<name>`, or `GET /action/<name>`.

The response includes `openclaw_sent` and `queued_commands`. Events forwarded to OpenClaw do not queue commands by themselves; Xiaopai executes commands that OpenClaw sends through the command API and the existing `/device/next-command` long-poll loop.

## Audio Upload

The firmware uploads detected speech here:

```http
POST /upload-audio
Content-Type: audio/wav
X-Device-Id: <device_id>
```

`/upload-audio` is an alias of `/upload`.

If OpenClaw is configured with `OPENCLAW_BASE_URL` and `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, non-empty ASR text is sent directly as the chat `user.content`. The server does not read or parse OpenClaw response text, tags, or actions. The OpenClaw agent may call `workAssistant.handleEvent` for supported business intents, or answer directly for ordinary conversation and presentation-only requests. OpenClaw should call the command API when it wants Xiaopai to speak, move, or change expression.

Response:

```json
{
  "type": "stt",
  "text": "用户说的话",
  "task_id": "aliyun-task-id",
  "device_id": "44:1b:f6:e4:83:8c",
  "handled_as": "openclaw_forwarded",
  "dialog_awake": true,
  "openclaw_enabled": true,
  "openclaw_sent": true,
  "queued_commands": []
}
```

Other non-empty ASR text still queues the demo repeat `sequence`.

## TTS Stream

The firmware uses this endpoint when executing `speak` commands:

```http
GET /stream-speak?text=<text>
```

Response format:

```text
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
X-Audio-Format: pcm_s16le
X-Sample-Rate: 16000
X-Channels: 1
```

Manual test:

```bash
curl -G 'http://127.0.0.1:8091/stream-speak' \
  --data-urlencode 'text=你好，Xiaopai。' \
  -o /tmp/xiaopai.pcm
```

## Image Upload

The image endpoint still exists:

```http
POST /upload-image
Content-Type: image/rgb565
X-Image-Format: rgb565
X-Image-Width: 320
X-Image-Height: 240
X-Device-Id: <device_id>
```

Image uploads are processed in memory by default. Set `STACKCHAN_CAPTURE_SAVE_MODE=raw` to save raw uploads, or `debug` to also save converted images and face-box visualizations. Without YuNet/OpenCV dependencies, image upload still works but face boxes are disabled.
